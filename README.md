# <Horiseon Webpage Revision>

## Description

The content of the website was already all there. It is a website that gives information and advice on how to expand your business using the internet. The were just come minor revisions that needed to be made. Such as debugging to make sure all aspects of the site worked. There was also a need to clean up and reorganize some of the code in order to make it more user-friendly to view. Comments were also made in order to make this happen. Through this process, I learned a lot about proper code organization and put into practice how to group multiple elements under a common selector.

## Usage

Use the navigation on the upper right corner of the page to select which topic you would like to learn more about.
